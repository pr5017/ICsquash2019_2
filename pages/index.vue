            At Imperial Squash, our <b>main</b> aim is to <b>build</b> the squash community at Imperial College.
             Whether it is playing <b>competitively</b> with the teams, participating as a <b>casual</b> social member <b>or</b>
             holding a raquet for the first time as a <b>beginner</b> we hope to see <b>you</b> on court.</p>
          <p class="blockquote">
            Becoming a member of <b>this</b> society allows you to book <b>free</b> courts during the year.
              Membership also allows you to come to the <b>regular</b> social sessions, where you can meet new people with varying levels of experiences and have fun. There will also be members of
              the competitive teams who can provide <b>coaching and tips</b>.
          </p>

          <p class="blockquote">
            <v-spacer>In addition to these sessions, there are also special squash events throughout the year, including a doubles tournament and mini-league.</v-spacer>
          </p>
